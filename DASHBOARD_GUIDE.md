# Fast Solutions - Dashboard Implementation Guide with Convex Integration

## Project Overview

**Dashboard Purpose:** Centralized hub for authenticated users to access, manage, and utilize all 8 Fast Solutions services through an intuitive, visually appealing interface.

**Tech Stack Addition:** Convex (Real-time Database), Clerk-Convex Integration  
**Design Continuity:** Maintains the Professional-Modern-Clean aesthetic from the main site with the established color palette and typography system.

---

## Phase 1: Convex and Clerk Integration Setup

### 1.1 Clerk-Convex Package Installation

**Required Package:**
Install the Clerk-Convex integration package using pnpm. This package provides seamless authentication synchronization between Clerk and Convex, enabling secure database operations tied to authenticated users.

**Command:**
```
pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react convex-helpers
```

### 1.2 ConvexProviderWithClerk Configuration

**Root Layout Integration:**
Modify the root layout file to wrap the application with ConvexProviderWithClerk. This provider must be nested inside the existing ClerkProvider, creating a hierarchy where Clerk authentication flows into Convex database access.

**Provider Hierarchy Structure:**
- Outermost: ClerkProvider (already configured)
- Middle: ConvexProviderWithClerk (new addition)
- Innermost: Application content and child components

**Props Configuration:**
The ConvexProviderWithClerk requires two essential props: the Clerk client instance and the Convex deployment URL. The Convex URL should be sourced from environment variables that were automatically generated when running npx convex dev.

### 1.3 Environment Variables Verification

**Required Variables:**
Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured in the .env.local file:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL (auto-generated by Convex)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (existing)
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY (existing)

**Route Hierarchy:**
```
/dashboard                          → Main Dashboard Overview
/dashboard/services                 → All Services Grid View
/dashboard/services/[serviceId]     → Individual Service Portal
/dashboard/projects                 → All Projects View
/dashboard/projects/[projectId]     → Project Details Page
/dashboard/requests                 → Service Requests Management

```

### 4.2 Dashboard Shell Component

**Component Structure:**
Create a reusable dashboard shell component that wraps all dashboard pages. This shell provides consistent layout structure including sidebar navigation, top header, and main content area.

**Responsive Behavior:**
The dashboard shell should adapt between desktop and mobile layouts. On desktop, display a persistent sidebar. On mobile and tablet, use a collapsible sheet-based sidebar triggered by hamburger menu.

### 4.3 Sidebar Navigation Design

**Layout Structure:**
Left-aligned vertical sidebar with fixed positioning on desktop. Width should be approximately 250-280px with smooth collapse animation capability.

**Visual Treatment:**
Background should use a lighter shade of the navy accent color or pure white with subtle border. Apply the brand color palette for consistency with the main site.

**Navigation Sections:**
Organize navigation items into logical groups with section headers:

**Primary Navigation Group:**
- Dashboard Overview (Home icon) - Links to /dashboard

- Settings (Settings icon) - Links to /dashboard/settings
- Billing (CreditCard icon) - Links to /dashboard/billing (future feature)

**Navigation Item Styling:**
Each navigation item should display icon on left, label text, and optional badge/counter on right. Active page should have distinct visual treatment using accent coral/orange color or lighter background fill. Hover states should show subtle background color change.

**Sidebar Footer:**
Include user profile summary at bottom of sidebar showing avatar, user name, and email. Add logout option accessible via clicking the profile section or dropdown menu.

**Collapse Functionality:**
Implement sidebar collapse toggle button that minimizes sidebar to icon-only view, expanding on hover. Use chevron icon to indicate collapse/expand state.

**Center Section:**
Display page title or search bar depending on current route. Search should be contextual, searching within relevant data (projects, services, etc).

**Right Section:**
Include utility actions and user elements:

- Notifications bell icon with unread indicator badge
- User avatar with dropdown menu containing profile, settings, and logout options

**Notification Bell Functionality:**
Clicking bell icon should open popover or sheet displaying recent notifications. Show notification type icon, title, message preview, and timestamp. Include "View All" link to notifications page and "Mark All Read" action.

**User Avatar Dropdown:**
Display circular avatar image, user name, and email. Menu items should include View Profile, Account Settings, Billing, Help & Support, and Sign Out options.

### 4.5 Main Content Area

**Container Structure:**
The main content area should occupy remaining space after accounting for sidebar and header. Use proper padding and max-width constraints for optimal readability.

**Background Treatment:**
Use the cream background color from brand palette or light gray for subtle contrast. Individual cards and panels should use pure white backgrounds.

**Spacing System:**
Apply generous padding around content sections (minimum 24-32px). Use consistent gap spacing between cards and components following the brand's spacing philosophy.
